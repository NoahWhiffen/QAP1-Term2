                     A Brief History
                  </h1>
                  <p>
                     Ford Motor Company was founded by Henry Ford on June 16, 1903. The company revolutionized the automotive industry with the 
                     introduction of the assembly line in 1913, drastically reducing production time and costs. This innovation led to the mass 
                     production of the Model T, launched in 1908, which became immensely popular and made car ownership accessible to the average American.

                     Throughout the 20th century, Ford expanded its lineup and global reach, introducing iconic models like the Mustang in 1964. The company faced challenges, 
                     including economic downturns and increased competition, particularly from foreign automakers.
                     In the 2000s, Ford underwent significant restructuring to improve efficiency and adapt to changing market demands, 
                     including a greater focus on fuel efficiency and sustainability. The company rebounded with successful models and a commitment to electric vehicles in the 
                     2020s, marking a new chapter in its long history. Today, Ford remains one of the largest and most influential automotive manufacturers in the world.
